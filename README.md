# bookbot

BookBot is my first [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project!

BookBot is a little program that takes a text file and generates a report
that calculates the total amount of words and characters in the book.
The characters are listed in the order of most to least occurring.

Usage: 
```
python3 main.py /path/to/file
```
